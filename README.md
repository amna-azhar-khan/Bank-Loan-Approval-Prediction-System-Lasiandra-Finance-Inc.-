•	Orchestrated automation of loan approval process through SEMMA framework in SAS Studio, reducing turnaround time and mitigating bias in lending assessments.
•	Evaluated socio-economic predictors of loan approvals by conducting univariate and bivariate statistical analyses on training (614) and testing (367) datasets.
•	Formulated a logistic regression model achieving an acceptable statistical fit (AIC = 680.724) with prediction probabilities ranging 0.80-0.87, identifying location and loan history as strongest predictive factors.
•	Detected data quality issues including class imbalance (263 approvals vs 58 rejections) and approval inconsistencies, where high-income applicants faced rejection despite strong financial profiles significantly.
•	Outlined strategies to enhance predictive model performance through multicollinearity mitigation, debt-to-income ratio addition, bias audits, and dashboard tracking, supporting equitable lending practices.
